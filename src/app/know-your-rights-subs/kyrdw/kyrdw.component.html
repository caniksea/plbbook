          <div>
            <p>A Will is a written document that records what should happen to your property and belongings when you die, provides for your minor children, and lets your family know how you would like to be buried. If you do not leave a Will, the law will decide how your property will be divided and this may take a long time.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Anyone who is 16 years or older, and is of sound and sober mind, can have a Will drawn up.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>If you are married, and regardless of the type of marriage you are in, you can write a Will – you don’t need your husband’s permission.</p>

          <li>It must list the full names and ID number(s) of people you want to receive your property when you die (the beneficiaries).</li>
          <li>If you’re the only surviving parent to your children, and they are younger than 18, the Will must contain the name and ID number of the person you want to look after your minor children.</li>

      <p>Inheritance is the money, property, debts, titles, rights and obligations that is passed on to someone else when a person dies.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Widows’ inheritance rights<br>
        In a civil marriage, if a husband dies without a Will, his property is divided up equally between his wife and children. In other types of marriages, different rules apply.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Inheritance rights for a woman in a customary marriage:<br>
        Three Acts apply to inheritance rights for women in customary marriages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Intestate Succession Act, No 81 of 1987, recognises customary polygamous marriages, and protects the rights of those in such marriages.</li>
        <li>The Reform of Customary Law of Succession and Regulation of Related Matters Act, No 11 of 2009, states that if you are in a polygamous marriage, you may inherit the equivalent of a child’s share of the husband’s estate. However, if the estate does not have sufficient money, then the estate gets divided equally between you and other surviving spouses.</li>
        <li>The Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act, No 27 of 1990, allows you to file a claim for maintenance against the deceased estate if you have not been provided with anything, or not been provided with enough, in your deceased partner’s Will.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Inheritance rights for a woman in a religious marriage:<br>
        Even though religious marriages (e.g. Hindu and Muslim) are not yet legally recognised, when it comes to inheritance, you are protected and you can claim maintenance if your spouse dies without a Will.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Inheritance rights for a woman in a domestic partnership:<br>
        No matter how long you have been in a domestic relationship, there is no law yet that recognises this form of marriage. You and your partner must get a Will drawn up as soon as possible. For more information, contact a legal aid clinic.</p>

          <th scope="col">ESTATES If a person dies leaving a Will, the deceased estate is referred to as a ‘testate estate’.

      <p><strong>Reporting a death for inheritance purposes</strong><br>
        Report the death to the Master’s Office close to a High Court (see page 206) nearest to where the deceased lived (not where he/she died). If there isn’t a Master’s Office close to you, contact your nearest Magistrates’ Court.</p>
    </div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <p>You must report the death within 14 days. When reporting the death, take with you certified copies of the following documents:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Will (if there is one).</li>
      <li>The death certificate.</li>
      <li>Your ID.</li>
      <li>The ID of the deceased.</li>
      <li>The ID of the person nominated as executor (if applicable).</li>
