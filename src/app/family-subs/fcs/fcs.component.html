          <p>It’s both parents’ duty to provide for their child’s wellbeing. This includes housing, education and clothing, as well as medical and other expenses.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Both parents need to support their child or children according to what they can afford. It doesn’t matter whether the child was born in a marriage or outside a marriage, or is adopted. It also doesn’t matter if the mother is no longer with the father of the child or is in another relationship</p>

            <p>Child maintenance is regular financial support that the parent without the main day-to-day responsibilities of caring for a child pays to the parent who is taking care of the child. in some cases, the person taking care of the child is a grandparent, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent.</p>

            <p>The maintenance Act, no 99 of 1998, and the children’s Act, no 38 of 2005, support your right to maintenance for your child.</p>

              <li>A maintenance officer will look into your case. they may hold an interview with both you and the father of your child/ren.</li>
              <li>If the maintenance officer is satisfied that all the necessary information has been provided and your case is valid, you will be given a court date.</li>
              <li>On that date, the magistrate will make a decision, taking into account the best interests of the child/ren, and based on the reasonable maintenance needs of the child/ren, and both parents’ ability to support the child or children.</li>

                    <p>An effective way to enforce child support is to have the payments taken directly from the other parent’s salary. the court can issue an order to the other parent’s employer to make sure this happens.</p>

          <p><strong>Child Support Grants</strong></p>

          <p>The child support Grant is intended to provide for the basic needs of south African children whose parents or primary caregivers are not able to provide sufficient support due to unemployment.</p>

          <p>A primary caregiver can be a parent, grandparent, or anyone who is mainly responsible for looking after and providing for the basic needs of the child. The primary caregiver is responsible for ensuring that the child is fed, clothed, immunised and given access to healthcare. The money from the grant must be used to benefit the child.</p>

          <p>Parents and primary caregivers qualify for the Child Support Grant if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The child is under the age of 18.</li>
            <li>The child lives with the primary caregiver and not in a state institution.</li>
            <li>The primary caregiver is over the age of 16.</li>
            <li>The primary caregiver is not paid to look after the child.</li>
            <li>The primary caregiver is a south African citizen or permanent resident.</li>
            <li>Both the child and primary caregiver live in south Africa.</li>
            <li>The primary caregiver passes the means test (which assesses financial need).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The ability to get the grant will depend on the financial situation of the primary caregiver and their spouse. If the primary caregiver is a single parent, he/she should first try to get money from the child’s other parent by applying for a maintenance order from the magistrates’ court.</p>

          <p>Payment of the grant</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The grant will be paid for all qualifying biological or legally adopted children. in the case of non-biological children and those who are not legally adopted, the grant will be paid for a maximum of six children. • &nbsp; the grant is paid to the primary caregiver, but the grant follows the child. this means that if someone else becomes the primary caregiver, then the grant goes to that person.</li>
            <li>There is a waiting period of up to three months before the primary caregiver receives payment. the first payment of the grant should include all the money from the date of application.</li>
            <li>If the application is not approved, a letter will be sent to give reasons for the rejection. You have the right to appeal against this decision.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Foster Child Grants</strong></p>

          <p>A foster child Grant is intended to provide for the basic needs of foster children who have been placed in the care of foster parents by a children’s court. The foster child Grant is paid to foster parents for children under 18 years old. An extension order for foster care can be given until the age of 21 years if the child is still at secondary school. Usually a grant is for two years but a social worker can extend the grant depending on the circumstances.</p>

          <p>A foster parent is responsible for ensuring that the child is fed, clothed, healthy, attending school and that the grant is used to benefit the child. SASSA (South African social security Agency) officers must always be allowed to have access to the child, as the situation of the child who is placed in need of care is reviewed from time to time.</p>

          <p>A social work review may take into account, whether the foster child:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Remains in the care of the parents.</li>
            <li>Is living in adequate housing.</li>
            <li>Is fed and given clothes to wear.</li>
            <li>Receives necessary medical and dental care.</li>
            <li>Goes to school regularly.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In order to apply for a Foster Child Grant, the following criteria must be met:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The applicant and the child must be resident in south Africa.</li>
            <li>The applicant must be in possession of a court order that makes the foster care status legal.</li>
            <li>The foster parent must be a south African citizen, permanent resident or refugee.</li>
            <li>The child must remain in the care of the foster parent.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If a child is severely disabled, the foster parent can get a Care Dependency Grant as well as a Foster Grant.</p>

          <p><strong>Grants for children with disabilities (Care Dependency Grants)</strong></p>

          <p>if you are the parent, foster parent or the primary caregiver of a child with a disability, who needs full-time and/or special care, you could qualify for a care dependency Grant.</p>

          <p>To qualify for a Care Dependency Grant:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You must be a south African citizen or a permanent resident.</li>
            <li>You must be the parent, primary caregiver or foster parent of the child.</li>
            <li>Both you and the child must live in south Africa.</li>
            <li>The child must be younger than 18 years old, have a severe disability and be in need of full-time care.</li>

            <p>South African schools begin with Grade R and end with Grade 12 or matric. Grades 1 to 9 are compulsory and classified as General education and training. Grades 10, 11 and 12 are considered to be further education and training.</p>

            <p>A child must obtain Grade 12 certificate (National Senior Certificate) that meets certain requirements to go on to university or college. Different tertiary institutions have different rating systems for acceptance into the courses they offer.</p>
