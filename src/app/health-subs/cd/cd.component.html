      <p>A chronic disease is a medical condition that lasts a long time – from a few months to an entire lifetime. Most chronic diseases are caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as not eating well or not getting enough exercise. Some are caused by exposure to environmental hazards, such as certain chemicals, while some are inherited (you’re born with them). Many chronic diseases are managable.</p>

      <p>Chronic diseases include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Heart disease.</li>
        <li>Stroke.</li>
        <li>High blood pressure.</li>
        <li>High cholesterol.</li>
        <li>Diabetes.</li>
        <li>Obesity.</li>

     <div class="subsection-header">Heart disease</div>
      <div >
      <p>Research shows that one in four south African women may develop some form of heart disease before the age of 60. The good news is that most heart diseases are preventable if they’re diagnosed early and treated properly.</p>

        <p>Risk factors for heart disease:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Genetic causes.</li>
          <li>High blood pressure.</li>
          <li>Obesity.</li>
          <li>Smoking.</li>
          <li>Diabetes.</li>
          <li>Excessive alcohol intake.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Heart failure</strong></p>

        <p>Heart failure happens when your heart can’t pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. the most common cause is high blood pressure.</p>

        <p>Warning signs and symptoms of heart failure:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity and when lying down.</li>
          <li>Unusual tiredness.</li>
          <li>Feeling lightheaded (dizzy or faint).</li>
          <li>Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs and body, and in the veins in the neck.</li>
          <li>Brownish discoloration of the tongue and nails.</li>
          <li>Going to the toilet to urinate often, especially at night.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you think you have heart failure:</p>

        <p><strong>Heart attack</strong></p>

        <p>A heart attack usually happens when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through an artery (a blood vessel that feeds oxygen-rich blood to the heart). This can damage or destroy part of the heart.</p>

        <p>Warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Chest pain that may feel like a heavy weight on the chest or a tightness around the chest.</li>
          <li>Pain or discomfort in the stomach, in one or both arms, or in the back, shoulder, neck or jaw.</li>
          <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
          <li>Sweating (often a cold, clammy sweat).</li>
          <li>Light-headedness.</li>
          <li>Nausea (feeling sick).<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The signs and symptoms of a heart attack in women may be milder than in men.</p>

        <p>Don't ignore any of these symptoms:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Mild discomfort in the chest, or a feeling of pressure or squeezing.</li>
          <li>Weakness in the body.</li>
          <li>Being very tired all the time for quite a long time.</li>
          <li>Not being able to sleep properly.</li>
          <li>Digestion problems, such as indigestion, nausea or vomiting.</li>
          <li>Feeling very anxious.</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p>High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a chronic condition where the force of the blood pushing against the blood-vessel walls is stronger than it should be. This means the heart has to work harder to circulate blood through the body. It can also damage the lining of the blood vessels.</p>

          <p>High blood pressure contributes to hardening of the arteries, stroke, kidney disease and the development of heart failure.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Risk factors for high blood pressure:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Ethnicity (black women are more likely to develop high blood pressure).</li>
            <li>Having a family history of high blood pressure.</li>

          <p><strong>The 'silent killer'</strong></p>

          <p>New research says that south Africa has the highest rate of high blood pressure reported among people aged 50 and over in the world, with consistently higher levels among women.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>A 2014 study (Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, conducted by the World Health Organization) says that only about one-third of people who tested positive for high blood pressure even knew they had it. This is why high blood pressure is often called the ‘silent killer’ – often, there are no symptoms.</p>

            <p>HOW IS BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURED?</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>A blood pressure reading has a top number (systolic) and bottom number (diastolic). normal: 120/80 or less.</p>

            <p>Pre-hypertension: When your blood pressure is above 120/80 but below 140/90. hypertension (high blood pressure): When your blood pressure is 140/90 or above.</p>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p>Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. It is naturally produced mostly in the liver but some cholesterol comes from the foods you eat, such as red meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.</p>

          <p>Your body needs a little bit of cholesterol to help your brain, skin and other organs grow and function. But if your body cannot process cholesterol or you eat food high in cholesterol, this can affect your general health.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Too much cholesterol in the bloodstream may cause some cholesterol to collect in the blood-vessel walls, causing these vessels to become narrower over many years. This means that not enough blood can ﬂ ow through these vessels to your heart. This can lead to heart attacks and strokes.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p><strong>Types of cholesterol</strong></p>

          <p>HDL cholesterol is called ‘good cholesterol’ because it helps remove ‘bad cholesterol’ from the arteries.</p>

          <p>LDL cholesterol is called ‘bad cholesterol’ because too much of it can harden your arteries and cause heart disease. It is produced naturally by the body, but many people inherit genes from their mother, father or even grandparents that cause them to make too much cholesterol.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Risk factors for bad cholesterol:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Age: Your risk increases as you get older.</li>
            <li>Gender: After menopause, women’s LdL levels increase quicker than men’s.</li>
            <li>Ethnicity: People of Asian and African descent tend to have more problems with cholesterol.</li>
            <li>Smoking.</li>
            <li>High blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Diabetes.</li>
            <li>Family history of premature heart problems.</li>
            <li>Being overweight.</li>
            <li>Diet: An unhealthy diet can increase a risk of high cholesterol.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p><strong>How to reduce your bad cholesterol</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Eat a healthy diet: cut down on red meat, eggs, butter, cheese and some margarines.</li>
            <li>Exercise every day: even 30 minutes of fast walking a day will help.</li>
            <li>Maintain a good weight and shape: carrying too much fat in your belly is associated with greater risk of heart problems.</li>

        <p><strong>Types of diabetes</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong></p>

        <p>Onset: Usually in early childhood.</p>

        <p>Cause: The pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, and is usually genetic or caused by the body’s immune system attacking its own pancreas cells.</p>

        <p>Risks:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Eye problems.</li>
          <li>Nerve problems.</li>
          <li>Kidney disease.</li>
          <li>Heart disease.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Prevention:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Cannot be prevented, but can be managed well.</li>
          <li>Have regular blood checks.</li>
          <li>Take medication as prescribed.</li>
          <li>Stop smoking.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong></p>

        <p>Onset: Usually starts in adulthood.</p>

        <p>Cause: The body is not releasing enough insulin or is resistant to the insulin released. People who are overweight are particularly vulnerable to diabetes.</p>

        <p>Risks:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Kidney failure.</li>
          <li>Heart disease.</li>
          <li>Stoke.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Prevention:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a healthy body weight.</li>
          <li>Eat plenty of fruit, vegetables, fish, chicken and whole grains, and less sugary food and starch.</li>
          <li>Exercise daily.</li>
          <li>Take medication as prescribed.</li>
