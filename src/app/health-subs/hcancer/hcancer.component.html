        <p>Cancer is a general word that describes the abnormal growth of cells anywhere in the body. It affects men, women and children of all ages, races, cultures and ethnic origin.</p>

        <p>Cancer can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental or physical factors. It is often difficult to identify a single risk factor. All cancers respond to different types of treatment.</p>

        <p>Scientists believe that it is the interaction of many factors together that produces cancer.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The factors&nbsp;involved may be genetic, physical or environmental.</li>
          <li>Family history may also play a role; your risk of developing breast cancer increases up to three times if your mother or sister has had breast cancer.</li>
          <li>Genetic causes of cancer are more common amongst children.</li>
        </ul>

        <div _ngcontent-gol-c6="" class="subsection-header">Breast Cancer</div><div _ngcontent-gol-c6=""><p>There is no way to prevent breast cancer. You can, however, keep your risk as low as possible by leading a healthy lifestyle – eating well, getting enough exercise, and not smoking.</p>

        <p>Early diagnosis of breast cancer is vital – the earlier it’s diagnosed, the better the chances of survival.</p>

        <p>If you notice any change in your breasts, see a doctor immediately. Remember to perform monthly self-examinations on your breasts and get your doctor to do a clinical examination once a year. After the age of 40, you will also need to have yearly mammograms.</p>

        <p>Risk factors for breast cancer:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Family history:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a close relative who has had breast cancer, you will be more likely to get it.</li>
          <li>Age: the risk increases as you get older.</li>
          <li>Gender: Although men do get breast cancer, women are more likely to get it.</li>
          <li>Genes: some people’s genes make them more likely to develop breast cancer.</li>
          <li>Dense breast tissue: more gland tissue and less fatty tissue increases the risk.</li>
          <li>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Women receiving HRT with oestrogen over several years have a higher risk.</li>
          <li>Race: Although white women are more likely to develop breast cancer, there is an increase among African women.</li>
          <li>Simple lifestyle changes such as healthy diet, staying active and not smoking are within our control.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Warning signs and symptoms of breast cancer:</p>

        <p>Symptoms may not be obvious in the early stages, and the warning signs of breast cancer are not the same for all women. Later symptoms include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A lump or swelling in or near your breast, or under your arm – usually painless, but can cause a prickly feeling.</li>
          <li>Change in nipple appearance (shape or colour/texture of skin).</li>
          <li>Itchy or irritated breast.</li>
          <li>General pain in or on any part of the breast (but most breast cancers aren’t painful).</li>
          <li>An inverted nipple – when your nipple is turned inward into the breast.</li>
          <li>Thickening of your breast in or near the breast or under the arm area.</li>
          <li>Unusual nipple discharge, especially if it’s stained with blood.</li>
          <li>Skin changes, such as swelling or redness.</li>
          <li>Changes in the shape of your breast.</li>
          <li>Changes in how your breast feels – hardness, tenderness or unusually warm</li>
        </ul>

                <li>A mammogram is an X-ray of your breast. if you’ve never had one before, and especially if you’re in a high-risk group for breast cancer, have your first mammogram at age 40. this is called your baseline mammogram. You’ll need to have a mammogram every year.</li>
                <li>You can also have radiological assessments – these are breast examinations by mammogram, ultrasound or MRI scan.</li>

South African national guidelines estimate that one in 41 women will develop this form of cancer in their lifetime.</p>

      <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

          <td>Most cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which is spread by sexual contact.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Cervical cancer develops very slowly – over as long as 20 years or more. early diagnosis is very important.</p>

      <p>Risk factors for cervical cancer:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sexual contact while you have symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or are being treated for an STI.</li>
        <li>Intimate sexual contact (oral, anal or vaginal) with anyone who has symptoms of an STI, may have been exposed to an STI, or is being treated for an STI.</li>
        <li>Having more than one sexual partner.</li>
        <li>Not using a condom.</li>
        <li>Smoking: Women who smoke have a higher risk for cervical cell changes that can lead to cervical cancer.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Signs and symptoms of cervical cancer:</p>

      <p>Usually, there are no symptoms of this cancer. often, the first clue is a Pap smear that is abnormal. Later symptoms may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bleeding from the vagina that is not normal, such as bleeding between menstrual periods, after sex or after menopause.</li>
        <li>Pain in the lower belly or pelvis.</li>
        <li>Pain during sex.</li>
        <li>Vaginal discharge that isn’t normal.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>How to protect yourself against cervical cancer:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Have regular Pap-smear tests, which can find changes in cervical cells before they turn into cancer, so they can be treated.</li>
        <li>If you’re younger than 26, get vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV). the vaccines cervix and Gardasil protect against two types of HPV that cause cervical cancer.</li>
      </ul>
