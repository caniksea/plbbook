          <p>In South Africa, generally the legal age of consent (that is, agreement) to have sex with another consenting adult is 16, but some exceptions apply.</p>

          <p>The consequences of having sex, and especially unprotected sex, can be life changing: an unwanted pregnancy, or at worst, a disease that could kill you. So it’s very clear that with sex, regardless of your age, comes responsibility.</p>

Adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle, and give up smoking, drinking and recreational drugs if you take these.</p>

      <p>A new baby usually costs time and money. find out what the maternity-leave policy is at your work. Look carefully at your finances. If necessary, get a financial planner to help you – all South African banks offer free help with financial planning.</p>

      <p>It’s also a good idea to see your doctor. Tell him/her about your family medical history.</p>

      <p>When you become pregnant, you should be able to continue life as usual. Make sure you take folic acid, a B vitamin that promotes healthy red blood cells and helps to prevent serious birth defects. You can get folic acid from your nearest clinic or pharmacy.</p>

      <p>Make your first antenatal (pre-birth) appointment. You can do this as early as six or seven weeks (that is, two to three weeks after your missed period) in the pregnancy. At 11–14 weeks, your doctor will screen for down syndrome, high blood pressure specific to pregnancy (pre-eclampsia) and other medical conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Unplanned pregnancy</strong></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>For many women, the surprise of an unplanned pregnancy comes with worry about lifestyle choices they may have made in the first few weeks after conception. These include smoking, drinking alcohol and/or coffee, taking drugs (either recreational or prescription), and being very stressed.</p>

        <p>Most unplanned pregnancies will be normal and healthy, but studies do show that women who have unplanned pregnancies are at increased risk of health problems, for both themselves and the baby.</p>

        <p>If you’re not sure whether you’re ready to have a child, speak to your family and health provider for advice. Don’t be fooled by adverts promising safe, easy and cheap abortions. Having a ‘backstreet’ abortion can seriously damage your health or even lead to death.</p>

      <p>Many women, especially those who are first-time mothers, don’t know what to expect when they go into labour. To find out everything you need to know, it’s very important that you attend a prenatal class, that you ask your health provider (doctor or nurse) questions when you go for your check-ups, and that you get good information from trusted family and friends.</p>

      <p>It’s a good idea to have a ‘birth plan’ – a written document that lets your doctor or midwife know how you’d like to manage your labour and delivery. This would cover topics such as pain management and possible emergencies such as a C-section (a Caesarean).</p>

      <p>You also need a trusted birth partner – this can be your husband, boyfriend, life companion, mother, sister or best friend.</p>

The huge changes to your lifestyle, as well as the hormones your body produces, can result in ‘baby blues’ (feeling like crying is normal during the first few weeks after childbirth) or more serious postnatal depression. In South Africa, 48% of new mothers suffer from postnatal depression.</p>

      <p>If you are having problems, speak to a trusted family member and see a doctor as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Symptoms of postnatal depression:</p>

      <ul>

This usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55. ‘Early-onset’ or premature menopause happens before the age of 40. You will manage your menopause better if you lead a healthy lifestyle, with good food, regular exercise and enough sleep.</p>

        <p>A woman is considered to have gone through menopause when she hasn’t had a period for a year. The intensity of symptoms vary, and for some women they might be severe. If you’re struggling, speak to your doctor.</p>

        <p><strong>What is Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)?</strong></p>

        <p>Premenstrual syndrome, commonly known as Pms, is a combination of physical and psychological symptoms that most women experience two weeks to a few days before the beginning of their monthly menstrual periods.</p>

        <p>The symptoms may vary from one woman to another and from one cycle to the next. Symptoms may be mild and manageable, or severe, resulting in absenteeism from school or work, or even stress on personal relationships.</p>

        <p>PMS is believed to be caused by hormonal changes in the body during the menstrual cycle. Changes in certain chemicals in the brain are responsible for the psychological symptoms.</p>

These include HIV, chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhoea, syphilis and some forms of hepatitis. These infections are very common: over 4 million people get treatment for STIs in South Africa every year.</p>

      <p>HIV is also an STI. All STIs have the potential to cause serious damage if not treated.</p>

      <p><strong>Safe sex</strong></p>

      <p>Having safe sex means taking steps to protect yourself and your partner from getting harmful infections. If you have unprotected sex, you increase the risk of getting STIs, including HIV.</p>

      <p>Many women think they are safe from getting an STI because their partners don’t look sick but it is impossible to know if someone is infected just by looking at them. Many people with STIs don’t have any symptoms.</p>

      <p>If you or your partner have many sexual partners, the danger of contracting an infection is much higher.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Always use a condom (whether you use other contraceptives or not) – even if your partner doesn’t like it.</li>
        <li>Use each condom only once.</li>
        <li>Get tested regularly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Contact your local clinic or health department for details on where you can get free STI testing</p>

      <p><strong>Gonorrhoea</strong></p>

      <p>Gonorrhoea is a very contagious STI. It can even be passed on from mother to infant during childbirth. The disease is treated with antibiotics.</p>

      <p>As with many other STIs, women are more at risk of getting infected with gonorrhoea than men. It takes only one single act of unprotected sex with an infected partner to get it.</p>

      <p>Protect yourself by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Staying in a sexual relationship with only one partner who does not have any STIs.</li>
        <li>Using a condom every time you have sex (even if you’re also using other contraceptives). Use each condom only once.</li>
        <li>Getting tested – gonorrhoea is treatable once it’s detected.</li>
        <li>Asking your partner to get tested.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Risk factors for gonorrhoea:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A person who is a sexual partner of someone with gonorrhoea.</li>
        <li>Anyone who engages in unprotected sex.</li>
        <li>People who have unprotected sex with many sexual partners.</li>
        <li>People who have a current chlamydia infection.</li>
        <li>Women in polygamous relationships.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Signs and symptoms of gonorrhoea:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pain during intercourse.</li>
        <li>Cloudy, yellowish vaginal discharge which may have a nasty odour.</li>
        <li>Redness and swelling of the genitals.</li>
        <li>Burning or itchy vaginal area.</li>
        <li>Stomach pain.</li>
        <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding.</li>
        <li>Sometimes a very sore throat and pain when you swallow.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Chlamydia</strong></p>

      <p>Chlamydia is one of the most common STIs worldwide in women, especially among teenagers. It doesn’t have many symptoms in women and can linger for months or years before being discovered. It is easy to detect through a simple swab, and is completely curable with antibiotics.</p>

      <p>Symptoms of chlamydia:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vaginal discharge.</li>
        <li>Burning with urination.</li>
        <li>Severe period pains as a result of pelvic inflammation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Complications associated with chlamydia:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Chronic pelvic inflammation disease.</li>
        <li>Infertility.</li>
        <li>Ectopic pregnancy due to blocked tubes.</li>
        <li>It may be passed on to a baby by a mother during childbirth.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Syphilis</strong></p>

      <p>Syphilis is a bacterial infection. Like most STIs, it is spread by direct contact with a syphilis sore during anal, vaginal or oral sex.</p>

      <p>Any sexually active person can get syphilis through unprotected sex. It may also be passed from an infected mother to her unborn child.</p>

      <p>If left untreated, syphilis can cause long-term complications and can eventually lead to damage of the heart and nervous system. If diagnosed, however, it is completely curable with antibiotics.</p>

      <p>Signs and symptoms of syphilis:</p>

      <p>Syphilis develops in four distinct stages, with different signs for each stage. Most people show no signs at first.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The primary stage</strong> is when a firm, round lesion (sore) may form at the point the syphilis entered the body, but it’s painless and it heals within three weeks, so it may go unnoticed.</li>
        <li><strong>The secondary stage</strong> of syphilis (about eight weeks after contact) can produce signs including swollen glands, a rash or sores in the mouth, vagina or anus, and/ or reddish-brown spots on the palm of the hands and soles of the feet. these signs may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go for as long as a year.</li>
        <li>If you don’t get treatment at this stage, syphilis enters its <strong>latent stage</strong>, which can last for years without any signs and symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>The tertiary stage</strong> may develop many years later, and may damage your brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Protect yourself by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Taking control of your sexual health by learning more about stis.</li>
        <li>Staying in a monogamous sexual relationship with a partner who does not have any stis.</li>
        <li>Using a condom every time you have sex (even if you’re also using other contraceptives). Use each condom only once.</li>
        <li>Getting tested.</li>
        <li>Asking your partner to get tested.</li>

      <p>HIV/AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>

      <p>South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV/Aids in the world, with 5.6 million people living with HIV. Over 2 million children were orphaned due to Aids in south Africa in 2011.</p>

      <p>South African women face a greater risk of HIV infection.</p>

      <p><img alt="HIV-and-AIDS-Ribbon" src="assets/img/health/HIV-and-AIDS-Ribbon.png"></p>

      <p>HIV attacks the immune system. Someone infected with the virus (HIV positive) can live with it for many years without getting ill or showing symptoms. During this time, however, the virus damages the immune system and the person remains infectious, meaning that he or she can spread the virus to others.</p>

      <p>Over time, HIV can damage or weaken the immune system to such a degree that the body becomes unable to fight off other infections and diseases. This can result in Aids, or <strong>a</strong>cquired <strong>i</strong>mmune <strong>d</strong>eficiency <strong>s</strong>yndrome. Aids is made up of several medical problems, including infections and a low CD4 count. CD4 or t-cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection.</p>

        <li>Injections with contaminated needles (e.g. when intravenous-drug users share needles, or when healthcare workers are accidentally pricked by an infected needle).</li>
        <li>Use of contaminated surgical instruments (e.g. during traditional circumcision).</li>
        <li>A blood transfusion with infected blood.</li>

      <p><strong>Where can I get treatment for HIV and Aids?</strong></p>

      <p>If you find out you are HIV positive, there is treatment available from all South African clinics and hospitals. The treatment is made up of drugs called antiretrovirals, or ARVs. Your clinic can help you cope with your diagnosis, reduce risk behaviour and find other services such as nutrition information. Your healthcare provider will be able to tell you when it becomes necessary to take medication.</p>

      <p><strong>What are antiretroviral drugs?</strong></p>

      <p>Antiretroviral drugs are used in the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. they fight HIV by stopping or interfering with the reproduction of the virus in the body.</p>
