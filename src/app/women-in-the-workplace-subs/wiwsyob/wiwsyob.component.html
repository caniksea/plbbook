      <div>
        <p>A business is an entity that provides goods or services to customers. Businesses can operate in both the informal and formal sectors. Anybody can start a business but it needs hard work, careful thinking and planning, passion and basic business skills.</p>

        <p>Informal-sector businesses are usually not registered, taxed or monitored by any authority. They may include women who sell fruit and vegetables by the roadside, retail traders at marketplaces, a hair salon in a house or car repair in a backyard.</p>

        <p>Formal businesses are registered, pay taxes and value-added tax (VAT), and are governed by the Companies Act, No 71 of 2008.</p>

                <li>Do i have the skills and personality traits (creativity, fl exibility, perseverance, commitment and management skills) to succeed as an entrepreneur?</li>

          <p>There are various kinds of formal business, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The Companies Act of 2008 also provides for two categories: non-profit and for-profit companies.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal liability company – Inc:</strong>

              <p>This is a business registered by professionals who are jointly and severally liable for the company’s debts. This means that no matter how much the business owes, all the partners are responsible for the debt, and may even have their personal property seized to settle debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Private business – (Pty) Ltd:</strong>
              <p>This is a proprietary company and must have at least one shareholder but no more than 50. There is a slight advantage to writing ‘(Pty) Ltd’ after your company’s name because it is viewed as being more stable and established.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Public company – Ltd: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Name must end with the word limited (Ltd).</li>
                <li>The incorporators of the company must consist of at least one person.</li>
                <li>The company must have at least three directors.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Closed Corporations – CC:</strong>
              <p>Under the Act, it will no longer be possible to register new closed corporations, nor may companies be converted into one. Existing closed corporations will be treated as private companies.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-profit companies – NPC:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>They are incorporated for a public benefit or purpose such as foundations, churches or charitable organisations.</li>
                <li>A minimum of three persons, called incorporators, must complete and sign the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI).</li>
                <li>A minimum of three directors must be approved.</li>
                <li>All assets and income of the company must be used to advance its stated objective</li>
