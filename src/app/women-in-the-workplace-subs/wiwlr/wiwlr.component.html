                <p><strong>PAYE, which stands for ‘Pay As You Earn’, is the tax your employer takes off your monthly
                  salary and pays on your behalf to SARS. This system allows the total amount of tax that you have to pay

          <div>
            <p>Income tax is the money that is deducted from your income (your wages/salary, your business/trade or an
              investment) and goes to the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The government uses this money to
              provide key services such as healthcare and education, good roads and other public services.</p>

            <p>The amount of tax you pay depends on what you earn.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>To register as a taxpayer, you need to fill in an IT77 registration form – you can do this at your
              nearest SARS office. You will then need to submit an income tax return by a certain deadline each
              year.</p>

            <p>Your contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) are deducted from your monthly salary by your
              employer, who also contributes to the fund. You each contribute 1% of your monthly salary.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>The UIF provides an income for you if you ever become unemployed due to reasons that aren’t your fault,
              if you get sick or if you need to go on maternity leave. It will also provide relief to your dependants if
              you die.</p>

          <div>
            <div>
              <p>To claim from the UIF, you need to fill in the forms at your nearest Department of Labour. Your
                employer should also be able to help you.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>You can’t claim from the UIF if you resigned from your job.</li>

            <div>
              <p>In South Africa, the law recognises the dual role of women as mothers and as part of the labour force.
                Women have the right to four months of maternity leave, which can start any time from four weeks before
                your expected due date.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Your employer must keep your position open during that time, so you can return to it when your
                maternity leave is over. Your employer doesn’t have to pay you while you’re on maternity leave. Make
                sure you know what your company’s maternity leave policy is.</p>

          <div class="subsection-header">Losing your job or being unemployed</div>
          <div>
            <p>Being retrenched is a shocking event that can cause a lot of worry and stress.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>If you’re being retrenched, your employer must first speak to you about a reasonable severance package.
              The severance package can’t be less than one week’s remuneration for each completed year of service. You
              could also be entitled to notice pay.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>If you’ve been contributing to the UIF, you can claim unemployment benefits from your nearest Department
              of Labour.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>If you find yourself unemployed, it’s very important for you to keep busy and look after yourself.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Try to keep healthy: Exercise (even if it’s just going for a walk) at least three times a week for
                40–60 minutes; eat well, including lots of fresh vegetables; drink plenty of water; try to avoid (or at
                least cut down on) coffee, alcohol and cigarettes; and get enough sleep (six to eight hours per night).
              </li>
              <li>Keep your personal appearance neat and clean; try to keep up your personal interests and hobbies; and
                treat yourself regularly by going on a picnic or preparing a special meal.
              </li>
              <li>Try not to go into debt. Ask family members to help by not expecting you to provide or do the things
                you used to do while you were working.
              </li>
              <li>Don’t carry your fear into your next job. People who have been retrenched may be anxious about losing
                their job again. Remind yourself of your strong points and achievements, and keep believing in yourself.
              </li>
              <li>Get help if you feel you’re not coping. The shock of retrenchment can have a big effect on your
                behaviour. Smoking or drinking more, taking drugs, or eating or sleeping either more or less than usual,
                are all stress responses. Get help from your nearest doctor or clinic.
              </li>
              <li>Most importantly, have a plan: Make a list of the things you have to do every day, including
                job-hunting (see page 144). Think about finding a place where you can volunteer – not only will this
                help you not to feel ‘useless’, but you will get experience that may help you when looking for a job.
              </li>
