                  <p>The Consumer Protection Act (CPA), No 68 of 2008, protects consumers from poorquality goods and services.
                    It also prohibits unfair practices, sets out the requirements for certain consumer contracts, and provides
                    licencing requirements for regulated businesses.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>This means that you have the right to demand good service and quality products. The law also protects you
                    against businesses that give misleading or inaccurate information about what they are offering you.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>If you feel any of your rights under the Consumer Protection Act have been ignored or breached, first
                    raise the matter directly with the customer-care department of the business concerned. If you’re not
                    satisfied with the result, contact the CPA Complaints Handling Unit and/or your Provincial Consumer
                    Affairs office.</p>

                    In a civil marriage, if a husband dies without a Will, his property is divided up equally between his wife
                    and children. In other types of marriages, different rules apply.</p>

                  <p>Inheritance rights for a woman in a customary marriage:<br>
                    Three Acts apply to inheritance rights for women in customary marriages:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The Intestate Succession Act, No 81 of 1987, recognises customary polygamous marriages, and protects
                      the rights of those in such marriages.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Reform of Customary Law of Succession and Regulation of Related Matters Act, No 11 of 2009, states
                      that if you are in a polygamous marriage, you may inherit the equivalent of a child’s share of the
                      husband’s estate. However, if the estate does not have sufficient money, then the estate gets divided
                      equally between you and other surviving spouses.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act, No 27 of 1990, allows you to file a claim for maintenance
                      against the deceased estate if you have not been provided with anything, or not been provided with
                      enough, in your deceased partner’s Will.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>Inheritance rights for a woman in a religious marriage:<br>
                    Even though religious marriages (e.g. Hindu and Muslim) are not yet legally recognised, when it comes to
                    inheritance, you are protected and you can claim maintenance if your spouse dies without a Will.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>Inheritance rights for a woman in a domestic partnership:<br>
                    No matter how long you have been in a domestic relationship, there is no law yet that recognises this form
                    of marriage. You and your partner must get a Will drawn up as soon as possible. For more information,
                    contact a legal aid clinic.</p>

                  <p>South African law requires that you register the birth of your child within 30 days after birth. If you
                    don’t do this, your child will not have a birth certificate, and therefore will be unable to enrol at a
                    school. Later, your child will have difficulty applying for an ID document. If you miss this 30-day
                    deadline, it is considered a late registration of birth and you’ll be required to submit more
                    documentation.</p>

              </div>

              <div>
                <p>To register a birth, you need your ID document and the child’s proof of birth from the hospital or
                  midwife who delivered your baby. If either parent is deceased, you will also need a copy of the death
