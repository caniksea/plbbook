          <p>
            Women need to have regular health check-ups to help them stay healthy. A health assessment will alert you to
            any health risks, and your doctor will then help you to manage these. You should try to have a medical
            check-up once every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some cancers can be picked up in their
            early
            stages when treatment is often more effective and can lead to a cure. If you have risk factors, such as a
            family history of a disease, it may be more likely that you will develop that disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            At your check-up, talk to your doctor about your medical history, your family’s history of disease, and your
            lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise and if you smoke or drink alcohol.

              <li>Medications/supplements you may be taking: take these with you, in their correct containers. this

          <p>A chronic disease is a medical condition that lasts a long time – from a few
            months to an entire lifetime. Most chronic diseases are caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as not
            eating
            well or not getting enough exercise. Some are caused by exposure to environmental hazards, such as certain
            chemicals, while some are inherited (you’re born with them). Many chronic diseases are managable.</p>
          <p>Chronic diseases include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heart disease.</li>
            <li>Stroke.</li>
            <li>High blood pressure.</li>

          <div class="subsection-header">Heart disease</div>
          <div>
            <p>Research shows that one in four south African women may develop some form of
              heart disease before the age of 60. The good news is that most heart diseases are preventable if they’re
              diagnosed early and treated properly.</p>
            <p>Risk factors for heart disease:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Genetic causes.</li>
              <li>High blood pressure.</li>

            <p><strong>Heart failure</strong></p>
            <p>Heart failure happens when your heart can’t pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. the most
              common cause is high blood pressure.</p>
            <p>Warning signs and symptoms of heart failure:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity and when lying down.</li>
              <li>Unusual tiredness.</li>
              <li>Feeling lightheaded (dizzy or faint).</li>
              <li>Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs and body, and in the veins in the neck.</li>

            <p><strong>Heart attack</strong></p>
            <p>A heart attack usually happens when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through an artery (a blood
              vessel that feeds oxygen-rich blood to the heart). This can damage or destroy part of the heart.</p>
            <p>Warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chest pain that may feel like a heavy weight on the chest or a tightness around the chest.</li>
              <li>Pain or discomfort in the stomach, in one or both arms, or in the back, shoulder, neck or jaw.
              </li>

          <div class="subsection-header">Stroke</div>
          <div>
            <p>A stroke happens when a blood vessel to the brain ruptures or breaks or when
              a blood vessel to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may mean that part of the brain can’t get
              enough blood, and therefore is not getting enough oxygen. This can lead to that part of the brain dying.
              A stroke can cause serious disability or even death.</p>
            <p>Risk factors for stroke:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Having high blood pressure.</li>
              <li>Having diabetes.</li>
              <li>Women who smoke and are on the Pill.</li>
              <li>An unhealthy lifestyle, including a high-fat diet.</li>

          <div class="subsection-header">High blood pressure</div>
          <div>
            <p>High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a chronic condition where the force of the
              blood pushing against the blood-vessel walls is stronger than it should be. This means the heart
              has to work harder to circulate blood through the body. It can also damage the lining of the blood
              vessels.</p>
            <p>High blood pressure contributes to hardening of the arteries, stroke, kidney disease and the
              development of heart failure.</p>
            <p>Risk factors for high blood pressure:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ethnicity (black women are more likely to develop high blood pressure).</li>
              <li>Having a family history of high blood pressure.</li>
              <li>Being overweight or obese.</li>
              <li>Having diabetes.</li>
              <li>Smoking.</li>
              <li>Not getting enough exercise.</li>
              <li>Pregnancy (for some women).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The 'silent killer'</strong></p>
            <p>New research says that south Africa has the highest rate of high blood pressure reported among
              people aged 50 and over in the world, with consistently higher levels among women.</p>
            <p>A 2014 study (Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, conducted by the World Health
              Organization) says that only about one-third of people who tested positive for high blood pressure
              even knew they had it. This is why high blood pressure is often called the ‘silent killer’ –
              often, there are no symptoms.</p>
            <p>HOW IS BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURED?</p>
            <p>A blood pressure reading has a top number (systolic) and bottom number (diastolic). normal:
              120/80 or less.</p>
            <p>Pre-hypertension: When your blood pressure is above 120/80 but below 140/90. hypertension (high
              blood pressure): When your blood pressure is 140/90 or above.</p>
            <p>Warning signs and symptoms of high blood pressure:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Severe headaches.</li>
              <li>Fatigue (feeling very tired).</li>
              <li>Being confused.</li>
              <li>Changes in how you see.</li>
              <li>Difficulty breathing.</li>
              <li>Irregular heartbeat.</li>
              <li>Pounding in the chest, neck or ears.</li>
              <li>Nose bleeds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>KEEP YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have your blood pressure checked regularly (at your doctor or your nearest clinic).</li>
              <li>Maintain a healthy weight by eating a sensible, balanced diet.</li>
              <li>Quit smoking, or don’t start.</li>
              <li>Limit the amount of salt in your food.</li>
              <li>Follow your doctor’s advice.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="subsection-header">High Cholesterol</div>
          <div>
            <p>Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. It is naturally produced mostly in the liver
              but some cholesterol comes from the foods you eat, such as red meat, fish, eggs and dairy
              products.</p>
            <p>Your body needs a little bit of cholesterol to help your brain, skin and other organs grow and
              function. But if your body cannot process cholesterol or you eat food high in cholesterol, this
              can affect your general health.</p>
            <p>Too much cholesterol in the bloodstream may cause some cholesterol to collect in the blood-vessel
              walls, causing these vessels to become narrower over many years. This means that not enough blood
              can ﬂ ow through these vessels to your heart. This can lead to heart attacks and strokes.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of cholesterol</strong></p>
            <p>HDL cholesterol is called ‘good cholesterol’ because it helps remove ‘bad cholesterol’ from the
              arteries.</p>
            <p>LDL cholesterol is called ‘bad cholesterol’ because too much of it can harden your arteries and
              cause heart disease. It is produced naturally by the body, but many people inherit genes from
              their mother, father or even grandparents that cause them to make too much cholesterol.</p>
            <p>Risk factors for bad cholesterol:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Age: Your risk increases as you get older.</li>
              <li>Gender: After menopause, women’s LdL levels increase quicker than men’s.</li>
              <li>Ethnicity: People of Asian and African descent tend to have more problems with cholesterol.
              </li>
              <li>Smoking.</li>
              <li>High blood pressure.</li>
              <li>Diabetes.</li>
              <li>Family history of premature heart problems.</li>
              <li>Being overweight.</li>
              <li>Diet: An unhealthy diet can increase a risk of high cholesterol.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to reduce your bad cholesterol</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Eat a healthy diet: cut down on red meat, eggs, butter, cheese and some margarines.</li>
              <li>Exercise every day: even 30 minutes of fast walking a day will help.</li>
              <li>Maintain a good weight and shape: carrying too much fat in your belly is associated with
                greater risk of heart problems.
              </li>
              <li>If high cholesterol runs in your family, speak to your doctor about medication.</li>

            <p>Failure of the body to produce insulin results in diabetes. insulin is a
              hormone in the body that controls blood sugar levels. It helps cells in the body to use glucose (sugar)
              for energy. Without insulin, the body can’t get the energy it needs from the food you eat.</p>

          <div class="subsection-header">Obesity</div>
          <div>
            <p>Obesity is a medical condition whereby excess fat is stored in the body.
              doctors often measure your body weight vs height ratio (body mass index or BMI). A body mass index above
              25 is considered obese (very overweight).</p>
            <p>Being overweight, and especially being obese, can trigger many health problems, such as heart attack,
              stroke and high blood pressure.</p>
            <p><strong>How to lose weight</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Get at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. this will be easier if you find activities that you
                enjoy.
              </li>
              <li>Cut down on foods that are high in salts, sugars, starches and unhealthy fats, especially fast
                foods (takeaways).
              </li>
              <li>Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables, and whole (unprocessed) foods.</li>
              <li>Drink lots of water every day.</li>
              <li>Get enough sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Risk factors for obesity:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Family history – genetics play a part.</li>
              <li>Not getting enough exercise.</li>
              <li>Unhealthy eating.</li>
              <li>Certain medications, such as some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, antipsychotic
                medications and steroids.
              </li>

          <div class="subsection-header">Athma</div>
          <div>
            <p>Asthma occurs when the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs become
              inflamed, meaning that they swell and produce lots of thick mucus. the muscles surrounding the airways
              tighten, making the airways narrow. this can cause shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness in the chest
              and coughing.</p>
            <p>Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children.</p>
            <p>Asthma can’t be cured or prevented, but with proper diagnosis and the right medicine and treatment,
              it can be controlled and managed. People with asthma can lead healthy lives – in fact, some of the
              greatest athletes in the world suffer from asthma, including Bafana Bafana and Ajax cape town
              goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs and Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Roland Schoeman.</p>
            <p>To manage asthma properly, you need to see your doctor first. He/she will measure your lung function
              (how well your lungs work) with a peak-flow meter, show you how to use an inhaler, explain what may
              trigger an attack and how to avoid this, and if necessary, prescribe additional treatment.</p>

          <div class="subsection-header">Tuberculosis (TB)</div>
          <div>
            <p>According to World health organization reports, South Africa is one of the
              countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis (TB), with an estimated 450 000 cases of active TB in
              2013.</p>
            <p>TB disease is a serious condition and can lead to death if not treated. It usually affects the lungs
              but it can also affect other parts of the body.</p>
            <p>TB is spread when small droplets of infected spit are coughed into the air by people who have TB, and
              then breathed in by people who do not have TB. People who are on effective TB treatment are less
              likely to infect others.</p>
            <p>To catch TB, you normally need close and prolonged contact with a person who has active TB in the
              lungs. The people most likely to be infected will be those in the same house or same family as a
              person diagnosed with TB.</p>

            <p>If you think you have TB:</p>
            <p>People with TB are considered infectious, and can spread TB bacteria to others. If TB is suspected,
              seek medical attention immediately for a complete medical evaluation. If it is determined that a
              person has TB disease, steps are taken to treat it.</p>
            <p>Treatment of TB:</p>
            <p>TB can be cured. Treatment is free at most government clinics and hospitals. Take your TB medicine
              exactly as the nurse or doctor tells you to. You may be asked to go back to the clinic for more spit
              tests, to make sure the medicine is working.</p>
            <p>Even if you start feeling better, you must ﬁnish all your TB medicine. The germ is hard to kill and
              this usually takes at least six months. If you stop taking your medicine, the germs may become active
              again. Then, when you start taking your medicine again, it won’t work so well.</p>

          <div class="subsection-header">Breast Cancer</div>
          <div>
            <p>There is no way to prevent breast cancer. You can, however, keep your risk as
              low as possible by leading a healthy lifestyle – eating well, getting enough exercise, and not
              smoking.</p>
            <p>Early diagnosis of breast cancer is vital – the earlier it’s diagnosed, the better the chances of
              survival.</p>
            <p>If you notice any change in your breasts, see a doctor immediately. Remember to perform monthly
              self-examinations on your breasts and get your doctor to do a clinical examination once a year. After
              the age of 40, you will also need to have yearly mammograms.</p>
            <p>Risk factors for breast cancer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Family history:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a close relative who has had breast cancer, you will be
                more likely to get it.
              </li>
              <li>Age: the risk increases as you get older.</li>
              <li>Gender: Although men do get breast cancer, women are more likely to get it.</li>
              <li>Genes: some people’s genes make them more likely to develop breast cancer.</li>
              <li>Dense breast tissue: more gland tissue and less fatty tissue increases the risk.</li>
              <li>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Women receiving HRT with oestrogen over several years have a
                higher risk.
              </li>
              <li>Race: Although white women are more likely to develop breast cancer, there is an increase among
                African women.
              </li>
              <li>Simple lifestyle changes such as healthy diet, staying active and not smoking are within our
                control.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Warning signs and symptoms of breast cancer:</p>
            <p>Symptoms may not be obvious in the early stages, and the warning signs of breast cancer are not the
              same for all women. Later symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A lump or swelling in or near your breast, or under your arm – usually painless, but can cause a
                prickly feeling.
              </li>
              <li>Change in nipple appearance (shape or colour/texture of skin).</li>
              <li>Itchy or irritated breast.</li>
              <li>General pain in or on any part of the breast (but most breast cancers aren’t painful).</li>
              <li>An inverted nipple – when your nipple is turned inward into the breast.</li>
              <li>Thickening of your breast in or near the breast or under the arm area.</li>
              <li>Unusual nipple discharge, especially if it’s stained with blood.</li>
              <li>Skin changes, such as swelling or redness.</li>
              <li>Changes in the shape of your breast.</li>
              <li>Changes in how your breast feels – hardness, tenderness or unusually warm</li>

            <p>Cancer of the cervix is the second most common form of cancer among south
              African women – it kills about 3 500 South African women every year. South African national guidelines
              estimate that one in 41 women will develop this form of cancer in their lifetime.</p>

              <tr>
                <td>Most cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which is spread by sexual

            <p>Cervical cancer develops very slowly – over as long as 20 years or more. early diagnosis is very
              important.</p>
            <p>Risk factors for cervical cancer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sexual contact while you have symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or are being
                treated for an STI.
              </li>
              <li>Intimate sexual contact (oral, anal or vaginal) with anyone who has symptoms of an STI, may have
                been exposed to an STI, or is being treated for an STI.
              </li>
              <li>Having more than one sexual partner.</li>
              <li>Not using a condom.</li>
              <li>Smoking: Women who smoke have a higher risk for cervical cell changes that can lead to cervical
                cancer.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Signs and symptoms of cervical cancer:</p>
            <p>Usually, there are no symptoms of this cancer. often, the first clue is a Pap smear that is abnormal.
              Later symptoms may include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bleeding from the vagina that is not normal, such as bleeding between menstrual periods, after sex
                or after menopause.
              </li>
              <li>Pain in the lower belly or pelvis.</li>
              <li>Pain during sex.</li>
              <li>Vaginal discharge that isn’t normal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How to protect yourself against cervical cancer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have regular Pap-smear tests, which can find changes in cervical cells before they turn into
                cancer, so they can be treated.
              </li>
              <li>If you’re younger than 26, get vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV). the vaccines
                cervix and Gardasil protect against two types of HPV that cause cervical cancer.
              </li>

          <div class="section-header">Anaemia</div>
          <div>
            <p>Anaemia is a medical condition where you have fewer red blood cells than normal, or you have less
              haemoglobin in each red blood cell than normal. This results in reduced amounts of oxygen being
              carried in the blood. Doctors may sometimes explain anaemia to patients as ‘weak blood’.</p>
            <p>Warning signs and symptoms of anaemia:</p>
            <p>Most people with anaemia may not know it because they may not have any symptoms.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Breathlessness when exerting little effort.</li>
              <li>A fast heartbeat or palpitations.</li>
              <li>Tiredness or feeling weak.</li>
              <li>Dizzy spells.</li>
              <li>Lethargy or low energy levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>WHAT CAUSES ANAEMIA?</strong></p>
            <p>There are many causes of anaemia, but the most common cause of anaemia in women is iron deficiency.
              Low intake of iron in the diet, poor absorption in the gut (intestines), or loss of iron from bleeding
              are common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Most women suffer from iron deficiency for the following
              reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pregnancy.</li>
              <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding.</li>
              <li>Bleeding from the gut due to ulcers or other intestinal diseases.</li>
              <li>A diet that doesn't have enough iron in it, such as vegetarian or vegan diets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prevention and treatment:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Take iron supplements before and during pregnancy as directed by your doctor.</li>
              <li>Report abnormal menstrual periods to your doctor (heavy bleeding with clots, or for more than 7
                days in a month).
              </li>
            </ul>

          <div class="section-header">Reproductive health</div>
          <div>
            <p>In South Africa, generally the legal age of consent (that is, agreement) to have sex with another
              consenting adult is 16, but some exceptions apply.</p>
            <p>The consequences of having sex, and especially unprotected sex, can be life changing: an unwanted
              pregnancy, or at worst, a disease that could kill you. So it’s very clear that with sex, regardless of
              your age, comes responsibility.</p>

          <div class="subsection-header">Contraception</div>
          <div>
            <p>Contraception is also called ‘birth control’ or ‘family planning’. There are many different
              contraceptive methods, including ‘natural’ methods (which don’t use devices or medication), hormones
              (which involve taking medication of some kind) and barrier methods (which block the sperm).</p>

            <p>A healthy pregnancy starts before you become pregnant. first and most
              important is to prepare your body. Adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle, and give up smoking, drinking and
              recreational drugs if you take these.</p>
            <p>A new baby usually costs time and money. find out what the maternity-leave policy is at your work.
              Look carefully at your finances. If necessary, get a financial planner to help you – all South African
              banks offer free help with financial planning.</p>
            <p>It’s also a good idea to see your doctor. Tell him/her about your family medical history.</p>
            <p>When you become pregnant, you should be able to continue life as usual. Make sure you take folic
              acid, a B vitamin that promotes healthy red blood cells and helps to prevent serious birth defects.
              You can get folic acid from your nearest clinic or pharmacy.</p>
            <p>Make your first antenatal (pre-birth) appointment. You can do this as early as six or seven weeks
              (that is, two to three weeks after your missed period) in the pregnancy. At 11–14 weeks, your doctor
              will screen for down syndrome, high blood pressure specific to pregnancy (pre-eclampsia) and other
              medical conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>What to expect at your first antenatal appointment</strong></p>
            <p>Your medical practitioner will ask you about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your general health/medical history (including chronic conditions, allergies, psychiatric
                issues, and habits such as smoking, drinking or drug use).
              </li>
              <li>Your family’s medical history (including whether any relatives have any chronic or serious
                conditions that may be hereditary).
              </li>
              <li>Your periods – if they’re regular and how long they last.</li>
              <li>When the first day of your last period was (to find out your baby’s due date). • &nbsp; &nbsp;Any
                symptoms or problems you’ve noticed since your last period.
              </li>
              <li>Any gynaecological problems (including stis).</li>
              <li>Details about any previous pregnancies.</li>
              <li>Whether you, the baby’s father, or anyone in either family has a chromosomal or genetic
                disorder, had developmental delays, or was born with a structural birth defect. You’ll be offered
                various screening tests, including a blood test that’s done at 9–13 weeks and, if it’s available,
                an ultrasound at 11–13 weeks.

            <p><strong>If you have epilepsy and want to have a baby, talk to your doctor. Most women with epilepsy
              can have a healthy pregnancy and baby, but you’ll need to be carefully monitored.</strong></p>
            <p>Your medical practitioner will do:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A physical examination.</li>
              <li>A pelvic examination, including a Pap smear if necessary.</li>
              <li>Possibly a culture to check for stis such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea.</li>
              <li>A urine sample.</li>
              <li>Blood tests to identify your blood type and check for anaemia.</li>
              <li>Your doctor will also test your blood for HIV and syphilis, hepatitis B and immunity to rubella
                (German measles), and chicken pox.
              </li>
              <li>Possibly an ultrasound to see how your baby is developing.</li>

            <p><strong>Unplanned pregnancy</strong></p>
            <p>For many women, the surprise of an unplanned pregnancy comes with worry about lifestyle choices
              they may have made in the first few weeks after conception. These include smoking, drinking alcohol
              and/or coffee, taking drugs (either recreational or prescription), and being very stressed.</p>
            <p>Most unplanned pregnancies will be normal and healthy, but studies do show that women who have
              unplanned pregnancies are at increased risk of health problems, for both themselves and the
              baby.</p>
            <p>If you’re not sure whether you’re ready to have a child, speak to your family and health provider
              for advice. Don’t be fooled by adverts promising safe, easy and cheap abortions. Having a
              ‘backstreet’ abortion can seriously damage your health or even lead to death.</p>

                <p>Many women, especially those who are first-time mothers, don’t know what to expect when they go
                  into labour. To find out everything you need to know, it’s very important that you attend a prenatal
                  class, that you ask your health provider (doctor or nurse) questions when you go for your check-ups,
                  and that you get good information from trusted family and friends.</p>

                <p>It’s a good idea to have a ‘birth plan’ – a written document that lets your doctor or midwife know
                  how you’d like to manage your labour and delivery. This would cover topics such as pain management
                  and possible emergencies such as a C-section (a Caesarean).</p>

                <p>You also need a trusted birth partner – this can be your husband, boyfriend, life companion,
                  mother, sister or best friend.</p>

              Follow your doctor’s advice and recommendations, and don’t miss any follow-up appointments or clinic
              visits.</p>

              <p>Besides bringing great joy, motherhood can also be a rollercoaster of emotions. The huge changes to
                your lifestyle, as well as the hormones your body produces, can result in ‘baby blues’ (feeling like
                crying is normal during the first few weeks after childbirth) or more serious postnatal depression. In
                South Africa, 48% of new mothers suffer from postnatal depression.</p>

              <p>If you are having problems, speak to a trusted family member and see a doctor as soon as
                possible.</p>

              <p>Symptoms of postnatal depression:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Feeling sad and/or crying a lot.</li>
                <li>Having trouble focusing, remembering or making decisions.</li>

                  <p>Menopause starts when your body gradually begins to produce fewer eggs and less of the female
                    hormones oestrogen and progesterone. menstruation (your period) becomes erratic and finally stops.
                    This usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55. ‘Early-onset’ or premature menopause happens
                    before the age of 40. You will manage your menopause better if you lead a healthy lifestyle, with
                    good food, regular exercise and enough sleep.</p>

                  <p>A woman is considered to have gone through menopause when she hasn’t had a period for a year. The
                    intensity of symptoms vary, and for some women they might be severe. If you’re struggling, speak
                    to your doctor.</p>

                  <p><strong>What is Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)?</strong></p>

                  <p>Premenstrual syndrome, commonly known as Pms, is a combination of physical and psychological
                    symptoms that most women experience two weeks to a few days before the beginning of their monthly
                    menstrual periods.</p>

                  <p>The symptoms may vary from one woman to another and from one cycle to the next. Symptoms may be
                    mild and manageable, or severe, resulting in absenteeism from school or work, or even stress on
                    personal relationships.</p>

                  <p>PMS is believed to be caused by hormonal changes in the body during the menstrual cycle. Changes
                    in certain chemicals in the brain are responsible for the psychological symptoms.</p>

                    <li>Eat as little salt and fatty foods (salt can make you retain water and become more bloated).

                    <li>Drink plenty of water.</li>
                    <li>Avoid alcohol and caffeine (for example in coffee and energy drinks).</li>
                    <li>Get plenty of sleep.</li>
                    <li>Taking calcium or a daily multivitamin supplement can be helpful.</li>

            <div _ngcontent-tmj-c11=""><p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), commonly referred to as sexually
              transmitted diseases (STIs) or venereal diseases (VDs), are infections that can be passed on via sexual
              activity involving the mouth, anus, vagina or penis. These include HIV, chlamydia, genital herpes,
              genital warts, gonorrhoea, syphilis and some forms of hepatitis. These infections are very common: over
              4 million people get treatment for STIs in South Africa every year.</p>

              <p>HIV is also an STI. All STIs have the potential to cause serious damage if not treated.</p>

              <p><strong>Safe sex</strong></p>

              <p>Having safe sex means taking steps to protect yourself and your partner from getting harmful
                infections. If you have unprotected sex, you increase the risk of getting STIs, including HIV.</p>

              <p>Many women think they are safe from getting an STI because their partners don’t look sick but it is
                impossible to know if someone is infected just by looking at them. Many people with STIs don’t have
                any symptoms.</p>

              <p>If you or your partner have many sexual partners, the danger of contracting an infection is much
                higher.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Always use a condom (whether you use other contraceptives or not) – even if your partner doesn’t
                  like it.
                </li>
                <li>Use each condom only once.</li>
                <li>Get tested regularly.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Contact your local clinic or health department for details on where you can get free STI testing</p>

              <p><strong>Gonorrhoea</strong></p>

              <p>Gonorrhoea is a very contagious STI. It can even be passed on from mother to infant during
                childbirth. The disease is treated with antibiotics.</p>

              <p>As with many other STIs, women are more at risk of getting infected with gonorrhoea than men. It
                takes only one single act of unprotected sex with an infected partner to get it.</p>

              <p>Protect yourself by:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Staying in a sexual relationship with only one partner who does not have any STIs.</li>
                <li>Using a condom every time you have sex (even if you’re also using other contraceptives). Use each
                  condom only once.
                </li>
                <li>Getting tested – gonorrhoea is treatable once it’s detected.</li>
                <li>Asking your partner to get tested.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Risk factors for gonorrhoea:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>A person who is a sexual partner of someone with gonorrhoea.</li>
                <li>Anyone who engages in unprotected sex.</li>
                <li>People who have unprotected sex with many sexual partners.</li>
                <li>People who have a current chlamydia infection.</li>
                <li>Women in polygamous relationships.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Signs and symptoms of gonorrhoea:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Pain during intercourse.</li>
                <li>Cloudy, yellowish vaginal discharge which may have a nasty odour.</li>
                <li>Redness and swelling of the genitals.</li>
                <li>Burning or itchy vaginal area.</li>
                <li>Stomach pain.</li>
                <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding.</li>
                <li>Sometimes a very sore throat and pain when you swallow.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Chlamydia</strong></p>

              <p>Chlamydia is one of the most common STIs worldwide in women, especially among teenagers. It doesn’t
                have many symptoms in women and can linger for months or years before being discovered. It is easy to
                detect through a simple swab, and is completely curable with antibiotics.</p>

              <p>Symptoms of chlamydia:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Vaginal discharge.</li>
                <li>Burning with urination.</li>
                <li>Severe period pains as a result of pelvic inflammation.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Complications associated with chlamydia:</p>

              <p><strong>Syphilis</strong></p>

              <p>Syphilis is a bacterial infection. Like most STIs, it is spread by direct contact with a syphilis
                sore during anal, vaginal or oral sex.</p>

              <p>Any sexually active person can get syphilis through unprotected sex. It may also be passed from an
                infected mother to her unborn child.</p>

              <p>If left untreated, syphilis can cause long-term complications and can eventually lead to damage of
                the heart and nervous system. If diagnosed, however, it is completely curable with antibiotics.</p>

              <p>Signs and symptoms of syphilis:</p>

              <p>Syphilis develops in four distinct stages, with different signs for each stage. Most people show no
                signs at first.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>The primary stage</strong> is when a firm, round lesion (sore) may form at the point the
                  syphilis entered the body, but it’s painless and it heals within three weeks, so it may go
                  unnoticed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The secondary stage</strong> of syphilis (about eight weeks after contact) can produce
                  signs including swollen glands, a rash or sores in the mouth, vagina or anus, and/ or reddish-brown
                  spots on the palm of the hands and soles of the feet. these signs may disappear within a few weeks,
                  or come and go for as long as a year.
                </li>
                <li>If you don’t get treatment at this stage, syphilis enters its <strong>latent stage</strong>, which
                  can last for years without any signs and symptoms.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The tertiary stage</strong> may develop many years later, and may damage your brain,
                  nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>Protect yourself by:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Taking control of your sexual health by learning more about stis.</li>
                <li>Staying in a monogamous sexual relationship with a partner who does not have any stis.</li>
                <li>Using a condom every time you have sex (even if you’re also using other contraceptives). Use each
                  condom only once.
                </li>
                <li>Getting tested.</li>
                <li>Asking your partner to get tested.</li>
              </ul>

              sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</p>

              <p>HIV/AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>

              <p>South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV/Aids in the world, with 5.6 million people living with
                HIV. Over 2 million children were orphaned due to Aids in south Africa in 2011.</p>

              <p>South African women face a greater risk of HIV infection.</p>

              <p><img alt="HIV-and-AIDS-Ribbon" src="assets/img/health/HIV-and-AIDS-Ribbon.png"></p>

              <p>HIV attacks the immune system. Someone infected with the virus (HIV positive) can live with it for
                many years without getting ill or showing symptoms. During this time, however, the virus damages the
                immune system and the person remains infectious, meaning that he or she can spread the virus to
                others.</p>

              <p>Over time, HIV can damage or weaken the immune system to such a degree that the body becomes unable
                to fight off other infections and diseases. This can result in Aids, or <strong>a</strong>cquired
                <strong>i</strong>mmune <strong>d</strong>eficiency <strong>s</strong>yndrome. Aids is made up of
                several medical problems, including infections and a low CD4 count. CD4 or t-cells are a type of white
                blood cell that fights infection.</p>

              <p><strong>Get tested</strong></p>

              <p>You can find out if you have HIV by having a blood test. the test looks for HIV antibodies that can
                be detected within three months of becoming infected.</p>

              <p>You can get a free HIV test in many places, including medical clinics, community health centres,
                hospitals, pharmacies, mobile testing vans, and community-based organisations that deal with HIV/Aids.
                contact your local clinic or health department for details.</p>

              <p>You have the right to privacy. You don’t have to tell your HIV status to your employer or colleagues,
                or anyone else. Your HIV status should not affect your job security, employee benefits or
                promotions</p>

              <p><strong>Where can I get treatment for HIV and Aids?</strong></p>

              <p>If you find out you are HIV positive, there is treatment available from all South African clinics and
                hospitals. The treatment is made up of drugs called antiretrovirals, or ARVs. Your clinic can help you
                cope with your diagnosis, reduce risk behaviour and find other services such as nutrition information.
                Your healthcare provider will be able to tell you when it becomes necessary to take medication.</p>

              <p><strong>What are antiretroviral drugs?</strong></p>

              <p>Antiretroviral drugs are used in the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. they fight HIV by
                stopping or interfering with the reproduction of the virus in the body.</p>
