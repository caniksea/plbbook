              <p>Women need to have regular health check-ups to help them stay healthy. A health assessment will alert you
                to any health risks, and your doctor will then help you to manage these. You should try to have a medical
                check-up once every year.</p>

              <p>Diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some cancers can be picked up in their
                early stages when treatment is often more effective and can lead to a cure. If you have risk factors, such
                as a family history of a disease, it may be more likely that you will develop that disease.</p>

              <p>At your check-up, talk to your doctor about your medical history, your family’s history of disease, and
                your lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise and if you smoke or drink alcohol.</p>

            <p>A chronic disease is a medical condition that lasts a long time – from a few months to an entire lifetime. Most
              chronic diseases are caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as not eating well or not getting enough exercise.
              Some are caused by exposure to environmental hazards, such as certain chemicals, while some are inherited
              (you’re born with them). Many chronic diseases are managable.</p>
            <p>Chronic diseases include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Heart disease.</li>
              <li>Stroke.</li>

            <div class="subsection-header">Heart disease</div>
            <div>
              <p>Research shows that one in four south African women may develop some form of heart disease before the age of
                60. The good news is that most heart diseases are preventable if they’re diagnosed early and treated
                properly.</p>

              <p>Risk factors for heart disease:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Genetic causes.</li>
                <li>High blood pressure.</li>

                    <p>High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a chronic condition where the force of the blood
                      pushing against the blood-vessel walls is stronger than it should be. This means the heart has to work
                      harder to circulate blood through the body. It can also damage the lining of the blood vessels.</p>

                    <p>High blood pressure contributes to hardening of the arteries, stroke, kidney disease and the development
                      of heart failure.</p>

                    <p>New research says that south Africa has the highest rate of high blood pressure reported among people
                      aged 50 and over in the world, with consistently higher levels among women.</p>

                    <p>A 2014 study (Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, conducted by the World Health Organization) says
                      that only about one-third of people who tested positive for high blood pressure even knew they had it.
                      This is why high blood pressure is often called the ‘silent killer’ – often, there are no symptoms.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p>Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. It is naturally produced mostly in the liver but some
                      cholesterol comes from the foods you eat, such as red meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.</p>

                    <p>Your body needs a little bit of cholesterol to help your brain, skin and other organs grow and function.
                      But if your body cannot process cholesterol or you eat food high in cholesterol, this can affect your
                      general health.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p>Too much cholesterol in the bloodstream may cause some cholesterol to collect in the blood-vessel walls,
                      causing these vessels to become narrower over many years. This means that not enough blood can ﬂ ow
                      through these vessels to your heart. This can lead to heart attacks and strokes.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p><strong>Types of cholesterol</strong></p>

                    <p>HDL cholesterol is called ‘good cholesterol’ because it helps remove ‘bad cholesterol’ from the
                      arteries.</p>

                    <p>LDL cholesterol is called ‘bad cholesterol’ because too much of it can harden your arteries and cause
                      heart disease. It is produced naturally by the body, but many people inherit genes from their mother,
                      father or even grandparents that cause them to make too much cholesterol.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p>Risk factors for bad cholesterol:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Age: Your risk increases as you get older.</li>
                      <li>Gender: After menopause, women’s LdL levels increase quicker than men’s.</li>
                      <li>Ethnicity: People of Asian and African descent tend to have more problems with cholesterol.</li>
                      <li>Smoking.</li>

                      <li>Being overweight.</li>
                      <li>Diet: An unhealthy diet can increase a risk of high cholesterol.</li>

                    <p><strong>How to reduce your bad cholesterol</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Eat a healthy diet: cut down on red meat, eggs, butter, cheese and some margarines.</li>
                      <li>Exercise every day: even 30 minutes of fast walking a day will help.</li>
                      <li>Maintain a good weight and shape: carrying too much fat in your belly is associated with greater risk
                        of heart problems.

              <div class="subsection-header">Diabetes</div>
              <div><p>Failure of the body to produce insulin results in diabetes. insulin is a hormone in the body that controls
                blood sugar levels. It helps cells in the body to use glucose (sugar) for energy. Without insulin, the body
                can’t get the energy it needs from the food you eat.</p>

                <p><img alt="Diabetes-Health" src="assets/img/health/Diabetes-Health.png"></p>

                <p><strong>If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including organ damage, heart disease,
                  stroke, vision loss, kidney failure, foot ulcers, foot amputation and even death.</strong></p>

                <p>If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, you need to be under a doctor’s care. Follow all advice and
                  treatment, and get regular check-ups.</p>

                <p>Risk factors for diabetes:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Family history.</li>
                  <li>Ethnicity: African people are more likely to get diabetes.</li>

                  <li>High cholesterol.</li>
                  <li>Age: People over 45 are more likely to get diabetes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Warning signs and symptoms of diabetes:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Increased thirst.</li>
                  <li>Increased tiredness.</li>
                  <li>Going to the toilet very often.</li>

                <p><strong>Types of diabetes</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong></p>

                <p>Onset: Usually in early childhood.</p>

                <p>Cause: The pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, and is usually genetic or caused by the body’s immune
                  system attacking its own pancreas cells.</p>

                <p>Risks:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Eye problems.</li>
                  <li>Nerve problems.</li>
                  <li>Kidney disease.</li>
                  <li>Heart disease.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Prevention:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Cannot be prevented, but can be managed well.</li>
                  <li>Have regular blood checks.</li>
                  <li>Take medication as prescribed.</li>
                  <li>Stop smoking.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong></p>

                <p>Onset: Usually starts in adulthood.</p>

                <p>Cause: The body is not releasing enough insulin or is resistant to the insulin released. People who are
                  overweight are particularly vulnerable to diabetes.</p>

                <p>Risks:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Kidney failure.</li>
                  <li>Heart disease.</li>
                  <li>Stoke.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Prevention:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Maintain a healthy body weight.</li>
                  <li>Eat plenty of fruit, vegetables, fish, chicken and whole grains, and less sugary food and starch.</li>
                  <li>Exercise daily.</li>
                  <li>Take medication as prescribed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The third type of diabetes is related to pregnancy and is called Gestational diabetes. Ask your doctor for
                  more information.</p>

              <div class="subsection-header">Obesity</div>
              <div><p>Obesity is a medical condition whereby excess fat is stored in the body. doctors often measure your body
                weight vs height ratio (body mass index or BMI). A body mass index above 25 is considered obese (very
                overweight).</p>

                <p>Being overweight, and especially being obese, can trigger many health problems, such as heart attack, stroke

                <p><strong>How to lose weight</strong></p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Get at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. this will be easier if you find activities that you enjoy.
                  </li>
                  <li>Cut down on foods that are high in salts, sugars, starches and unhealthy fats, especially fast foods
                    (takeaways).
                  </li>
                  <li>Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables, and whole (unprocessed) foods.</li>
                  <li>Drink lots of water every day.</li>

              <div _ngcontent-gol-c5=""><p>Asthma occurs when the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs become
                inflamed, meaning that they swell and produce lots of thick mucus. the muscles surrounding the airways
                tighten, making the airways narrow. this can cause shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness in the chest and
                coughing.</p>

                <p>Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children.</p>

                <p>Asthma can’t be cured or prevented, but with proper diagnosis and the right medicine and treatment, it
                  can be controlled and managed. People with asthma can lead healthy lives – in fact, some of the greatest
                  athletes in the world suffer from asthma, including Bafana Bafana and Ajax cape town goalkeeper Moeneeb
                  Josephs and Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Roland Schoeman.</p>

                <p>To manage asthma properly, you need to see your doctor first. He/she will measure your lung function (how
                  well your lungs work) with a peak-flow meter, show you how to use an inhaler, explain what may trigger an
                  attack and how to avoid this, and if necessary, prescribe additional treatment.</p>

              <div _ngcontent-gol-c5=""><p>According to World health organization reports, South Africa is one of the
                countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis (TB), with an estimated 450 000 cases of active TB in
                2013.</p>

                <p>TB disease is a serious condition and can lead to death if not treated. It usually affects the lungs but
                  it can also affect other parts of the body.</p>

                <p>TB is spread when small droplets of infected spit are coughed into the air by people who have TB, and
                  then breathed in by people who do not have TB. People who are on effective TB treatment are less likely to
                  infect others.</p>

                <p>To catch TB, you normally need close and prolonged contact with a person who has active TB in the lungs.
                  The people most likely to be infected will be those in the same house or same family as a person diagnosed
                  with TB.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Coughing that lasts three or more weeks.</li>
                  <li>Fatigue.</li>

                <p>If you think you have TB:</p>

                <p>People with TB are considered infectious, and can spread TB bacteria to others. If TB is suspected, seek
                  medical attention immediately for a complete medical evaluation. If it is determined that a person has TB
                  disease, steps are taken to treat it.</p>

                <p>Treatment of TB:</p>

                <p>TB can be cured. Treatment is free at most government clinics and hospitals. Take your TB medicine
                  exactly as the nurse or doctor tells you to. You may be asked to go back to the clinic for more spit
                  tests, to make sure the medicine is working.</p>

                <p>Even if you start feeling better, you must ﬁnish all your TB medicine. The germ is hard to kill and this
                  usually takes at least six months. If you stop taking your medicine, the germs may become active again.
                  Then, when you start taking your medicine again, it won’t work so well.</p>

            <p>Cancer can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental or physical factors. It is often difficult to

              <li>The factors&nbsp;involved may be genetic, physical or environmental.</li>
              <li>Family history may also play a role; your risk of developing breast cancer increases up to three times if

            <div _ngcontent-gol-c6=""><p>There is no way to prevent breast cancer. You can, however, keep your risk as low
              as possible by leading a healthy lifestyle – eating well, getting enough exercise, and not smoking.</p>

              <p>Early diagnosis of breast cancer is vital – the earlier it’s diagnosed, the better the chances of
                survival.</p>

              <p>If you notice any change in your breasts, see a doctor immediately. Remember to perform monthly
                self-examinations on your breasts and get your doctor to do a clinical examination once a year. After the
                age of 40, you will also need to have yearly mammograms.</p>

              <p>Risk factors for breast cancer:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Family history:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a close relative who has had breast cancer, you will be more
                  likely to get it.
                </li>
                <li>Age: the risk increases as you get older.</li>
                <li>Gender: Although men do get breast cancer, women are more likely to get it.</li>
                <li>Genes: some people’s genes make them more likely to develop breast cancer.</li>
                <li>Dense breast tissue: more gland tissue and less fatty tissue increases the risk.</li>
                <li>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Women receiving HRT with oestrogen over several years have a higher
                  risk.
                </li>
                <li>Race: Although white women are more likely to develop breast cancer, there is an increase among African
                  women.
                </li>
                <li>Simple lifestyle changes such as healthy diet, staying active and not smoking are within our control.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>Warning signs and symptoms of breast cancer:</p>

              <p>Symptoms may not be obvious in the early stages, and the warning signs of breast cancer are not the same
                for all women. Later symptoms include:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>A lump or swelling in or near your breast, or under your arm – usually painless, but can cause a prickly
                  feeling.
                </li>
                <li>Change in nipple appearance (shape or colour/texture of skin).</li>
                <li>Itchy or irritated breast.</li>
                <li>General pain in or on any part of the breast (but most breast cancers aren’t painful).</li>
                <li>An inverted nipple – when your nipple is turned inward into the breast.</li>
                <li>Thickening of your breast in or near the breast or under the arm area.</li>
                <li>Unusual nipple discharge, especially if it’s stained with blood.</li>
                <li>Skin changes, such as swelling or redness.</li>
                <li>Changes in the shape of your breast.</li>
                <li>Changes in how your breast feels – hardness, tenderness or unusually warm</li>

              <div _ngcontent-gol-c6=""><p>Cancer of the cervix is the second most common form of cancer among south African
                women – it kills about 3 500 South African women every year. South African national guidelines estimate that
                one in 41 women will develop this form of cancer in their lifetime.</p>

                    <td>Most cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which is spread by sexual

                <p>Cervical cancer develops very slowly – over as long as 20 years or more. early diagnosis is very
                  important.</p>

                <p>Risk factors for cervical cancer:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Sexual contact while you have symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or are being treated
                    for an STI.
                  </li>
                  <li>Intimate sexual contact (oral, anal or vaginal) with anyone who has symptoms of an STI, may have been
                    exposed to an STI, or is being treated for an STI.
                  </li>
                  <li>Having more than one sexual partner.</li>
                  <li>Not using a condom.</li>
                  <li>Smoking: Women who smoke have a higher risk for cervical cell changes that can lead to cervical
                    cancer.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Signs and symptoms of cervical cancer:</p>

                <p>Usually, there are no symptoms of this cancer. often, the first clue is a Pap smear that is abnormal.
                  Later
                  symptoms may include:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Bleeding from the vagina that is not normal, such as bleeding between menstrual periods, after sex or
                    after menopause.
                  </li>
                  <li>Pain in the lower belly or pelvis.</li>
                  <li>Pain during sex.</li>
                  <li>Vaginal discharge that isn’t normal.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>How to protect yourself against cervical cancer:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Have regular Pap-smear tests, which can find changes in cervical cells before they turn into cancer,
                    so
                    they can be treated.
                  </li>
                  <li>If you’re younger than 26, get vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV). the vaccines cervix
                    and Gardasil protect against two types of HPV that cause cervical cancer.
                  </li>
                </ul>

          <div class="section-header">Anaemia</div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p>Anaemia is a medical condition where you have fewer red blood cells than normal, or you have less
                haemoglobin in each red blood cell than normal. This results in reduced amounts of oxygen being carried in
                the blood. Doctors may sometimes explain anaemia to patients as ‘weak blood’.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Warning signs and symptoms of anaemia:</p>

              <p>Most people with anaemia may not know it because they may not have any symptoms.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Breathlessness when exerting little effort.</li>
                <li>A fast heartbeat or palpitations.</li>
                <li>Tiredness or feeling weak.</li>
                <li>Dizzy spells.</li>
                <li>Lethargy or low energy levels.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><strong>WHAT CAUSES ANAEMIA?</strong></p>

              <p>There are many causes of anaemia, but the most common cause of anaemia in women is iron deficiency. Low
                intake of iron in the diet, poor absorption in the gut (intestines), or loss of iron from bleeding are
                common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Most women suffer from iron deficiency for the following
                reasons:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Pregnancy.</li>
                <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding.</li>
                <li>Bleeding from the gut due to ulcers or other intestinal diseases.</li>
                <li>A diet that doesn't have enough iron in it, such as vegetarian or vegan diets.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Prevention and treatment:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Take iron supplements before and during pregnancy as directed by your doctor.</li>
                <li>Report abnormal menstrual periods to your doctor (heavy bleeding with clots, or for more than 7 days in
                  a month).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="section-header">Reproductive health</div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p>In South Africa, generally the legal age of consent (that is, agreement) to have sex with another
                consenting adult is 16, but some exceptions apply.</p>

              <p>The consequences of having sex, and especially unprotected sex, can be life changing: an unwanted
                pregnancy, or at worst, a disease that could kill you. So it’s very clear that with sex, regardless of your
                age, comes responsibility.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Contraception is also called ‘birth control’ or ‘family planning’. There are many different contraceptive
                  methods, including ‘natural’ methods (which don’t use devices or medication), hormones (which involve
                  taking medication of some kind) and barrier methods (which block the sperm).</p>

                is
                to prepare your body. Adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle, and give up smoking, drinking and recreational
                drugs
                if you take these.</p>

                <p>A new baby usually costs time and money. find out what the maternity-leave policy is at your work. Look
                  carefully at your finances. If necessary, get a financial planner to help you – all South African banks
                  offer free help with financial planning.</p>

                <p>It’s also a good idea to see your doctor. Tell him/her about your family medical history.</p>

                <p>When you become pregnant, you should be able to continue life as usual. Make sure you take folic acid, a
                  B
                  vitamin that promotes healthy red blood cells and helps to prevent serious birth defects. You can get
                  folic
                  acid from your nearest clinic or pharmacy.</p>

                <p>Make your first antenatal (pre-birth) appointment. You can do this as early as six or seven weeks (that
                  is,
                  two to three weeks after your missed period) in the pregnancy. At 11–14 weeks, your doctor will screen for
                  down syndrome, high blood pressure specific to pregnancy (pre-eclampsia) and other medical conditions.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Your periods – if they’re regular and how long they last.</li>
                    <li>When the first day of your last period was (to find out your baby’s due date). • &nbsp; &nbsp;Any
                      symptoms or problems you’ve noticed since your last period.

                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>For many women, the surprise of an unplanned pregnancy comes with worry about lifestyle choices they
                    may
                    have made in the first few weeks after conception. These include smoking, drinking alcohol and/or
                    coffee,
                    taking drugs (either recreational or prescription), and being very stressed.</p>

                  <p>Most unplanned pregnancies will be normal and healthy, but studies do show that women who have
                    unplanned
                    pregnancies are at increased risk of health problems, for both themselves and the baby.</p>

                  <p>If you’re not sure whether you’re ready to have a child, speak to your family and health provider for
                    advice. Don’t be fooled by adverts promising safe, easy and cheap abortions. Having a ‘backstreet’
                    abortion can seriously damage your health or even lead to death.</p>

                  <p>Many women, especially those who are first-time mothers, don’t know what to expect when they go into
                    labour. To find out everything you need to know, it’s very important that you attend a prenatal class,
                    that you ask your health provider (doctor or nurse) questions when you go for your check-ups, and that
                    you
                    get good information from trusted family and friends.</p>

                  <p>It’s a good idea to have a ‘birth plan’ – a written document that lets your doctor or midwife know how
                    you’d like to manage your labour and delivery. This would cover topics such as pain management and
                    possible emergencies such as a C-section (a Caesarean).</p>

                  <p>You also need a trusted birth partner – this can be your husband, boyfriend, life companion, mother,
                    sister or best friend.</p>

                <p>Besides bringing great joy, motherhood can also be a rollercoaster of emotions. The huge changes to your
                  lifestyle, as well as the hormones your body produces, can result in ‘baby blues’ (feeling like crying is
                  normal during the first few weeks after childbirth) or more serious postnatal depression. In South Africa,
                  48% of new mothers suffer from postnatal depression.</p>

                    <p>Menopause starts when your body gradually begins to produce fewer eggs and less of the female
                      hormones
                      oestrogen and progesterone. menstruation (your period) becomes erratic and finally stops. This usually
                      happens between the ages of 45 and 55. ‘Early-onset’ or premature menopause happens before the age of
                      40. You will manage your menopause better if you lead a healthy lifestyle, with good food, regular
                      exercise and enough sleep.</p>

                    <p>A woman is considered to have gone through menopause when she hasn’t had a period for a year. The

                      and manageable, or severe, resulting in absenteeism from school or work, or even stress on personal
                      relationships.</p>

                    <p>PMS is believed to be caused by hormonal changes in the body during the menstrual cycle. Changes in
                      certain chemicals in the brain are responsible for the psychological symptoms.</p>

              <div _ngcontent-gol-c9=""><p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), commonly referred to as sexually
                transmitted diseases (STIs) or venereal diseases (VDs), are infections that can be passed on via sexual
                activity involving the mouth, anus, vagina or penis. These include HIV, chlamydia, genital herpes, genital
                warts, gonorrhoea, syphilis and some forms of hepatitis. These infections are very common: over 4 million
                people get treatment for STIs in South Africa every year.</p>

                <p>HIV is also an STI. All STIs have the potential to cause serious damage if not treated.</p>

                <p><strong>Safe sex</strong></p>

                <p>Having safe sex means taking steps to protect yourself and your partner from getting harmful infections.
                  If
                  you have unprotected sex, you increase the risk of getting STIs, including HIV.</p>

                <p>Many women think they are safe from getting an STI because their partners don’t look sick but it is
                  impossible to know if someone is infected just by looking at them. Many people with STIs don’t have any
                  symptoms.</p>

                <p>If you or your partner have many sexual partners, the danger of contracting an infection is much
                  higher.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Always use a condom (whether you use other contraceptives or not) – even if your partner doesn’t like
                    it.
                  </li>
                  <li>Use each condom only once.</li>
                  <li>Get tested regularly.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Contact your local clinic or health department for details on where you can get free STI testing</p>

                <p><strong>Gonorrhoea</strong></p>

                <p>Gonorrhoea is a very contagious STI. It can even be passed on from mother to infant during childbirth.
                  The
                  disease is treated with antibiotics.</p>

                <p>As with many other STIs, women are more at risk of getting infected with gonorrhoea than men. It takes
                  only
                  one single act of unprotected sex with an infected partner to get it.</p>

                <p>Protect yourself by:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Staying in a sexual relationship with only one partner who does not have any STIs.</li>
                  <li>Using a condom every time you have sex (even if you’re also using other contraceptives). Use each
                    condom
                    only once.
                  </li>
                  <li>Getting tested – gonorrhoea is treatable once it’s detected.</li>
                  <li>Asking your partner to get tested.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Risk factors for gonorrhoea:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>A person who is a sexual partner of someone with gonorrhoea.</li>
                  <li>Anyone who engages in unprotected sex.</li>
                  <li>People who have unprotected sex with many sexual partners.</li>
                  <li>People who have a current chlamydia infection.</li>
                  <li>Women in polygamous relationships.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Signs and symptoms of gonorrhoea:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Pain during intercourse.</li>
                  <li>Cloudy, yellowish vaginal discharge which may have a nasty odour.</li>
                  <li>Redness and swelling of the genitals.</li>
                  <li>Burning or itchy vaginal area.</li>
                  <li>Stomach pain.</li>
                  <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding.</li>
                  <li>Sometimes a very sore throat and pain when you swallow.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Chlamydia</strong></p>

                <p>Chlamydia is one of the most common STIs worldwide in women, especially among teenagers. It doesn’t have
                  many symptoms in women and can linger for months or years before being discovered. It is easy to detect
                  through a simple swab, and is completely curable with antibiotics.</p>

                <p>Symptoms of chlamydia:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Vaginal discharge.</li>
                  <li>Burning with urination.</li>
                  <li>Severe period pains as a result of pelvic inflammation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Complications associated with chlamydia:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Chronic pelvic inflammation disease.</li>
                  <li>Infertility.</li>
                  <li>Ectopic pregnancy due to blocked tubes.</li>
                  <li>It may be passed on to a baby by a mother during childbirth.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Syphilis</strong></p>

                <p>Syphilis is a bacterial infection. Like most STIs, it is spread by direct contact with a syphilis sore
                  during anal, vaginal or oral sex.</p>

                <p>Any sexually active person can get syphilis through unprotected sex. It may also be passed from an
                  infected
                  mother to her unborn child.</p>

                <p>If left untreated, syphilis can cause long-term complications and can eventually lead to damage of the
                  heart and nervous system. If diagnosed, however, it is completely curable with antibiotics.</p>

                <p>Signs and symptoms of syphilis:</p>

                <p>Syphilis develops in four distinct stages, with different signs for each stage. Most people show no signs
                  at first.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The primary stage</strong> is when a firm, round lesion (sore) may form at the point the
                    syphilis entered the body, but it’s painless and it heals within three weeks, so it may go unnoticed.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>The secondary stage</strong> of syphilis (about eight weeks after contact) can produce signs
                    including swollen glands, a rash or sores in the mouth, vagina or anus, and/ or reddish-brown spots on
                    the
                    palm of the hands and soles of the feet. these signs may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go
                    for
                    as long as a year.
                  </li>
                  <li>If you don’t get treatment at this stage, syphilis enters its <strong>latent stage</strong>, which can
                    last for years without any signs and symptoms.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>The tertiary stage</strong> may develop many years later, and may damage your brain, nerves,
                    eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Protect yourself by:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Taking control of your sexual health by learning more about stis.</li>
                  <li>Staying in a monogamous sexual relationship with a partner who does not have any stis.</li>
                  <li>Using a condom every time you have sex (even if you’re also using other contraceptives). Use each
                    condom
                    only once.
                  </li>
                  <li>Getting tested.</li>
                  <li>Asking your partner to get tested.</li>
                </ul>

                transmitted infections (STIs).</p>

                <p>HIV/AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>

                <p>South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV/Aids in the world, with 5.6 million people living with
                  HIV.
                  Over 2 million children were orphaned due to Aids in south Africa in 2011.</p>

                <p>South African women face a greater risk of HIV infection.</p>

                <p><img alt="HIV-and-AIDS-Ribbon" src="assets/img/health/HIV-and-AIDS-Ribbon.png"></p>

                <p>HIV attacks the immune system. Someone infected with the virus (HIV positive) can live with it for many
                  years without getting ill or showing symptoms. During this time, however, the virus damages the immune
                  system and the person remains infectious, meaning that he or she can spread the virus to others.</p>

                <p>Over time, HIV can damage or weaken the immune system to such a degree that the body becomes unable to
                  fight off other infections and diseases. This can result in Aids, or <strong>a</strong>cquired
                  <strong>i</strong>mmune <strong>d</strong>eficiency <strong>s</strong>yndrome. Aids is made up of several
                  medical problems, including infections and a low CD4 count. CD4 or t-cells are a type of white blood cell
                  that fights infection.</p>

                <p><strong>Get tested</strong></p>

                <p>You can find out if you have HIV by having a blood test. the test looks for HIV antibodies that can be
                  detected within three months of becoming infected.</p>

                <p>You can get a free HIV test in many places, including medical clinics, community health centres,
                  hospitals,

                <p><strong>Where can I get treatment for HIV and Aids?</strong></p>

                <p>If you find out you are HIV positive, there is treatment available from all South African clinics and
                  hospitals. The treatment is made up of drugs called antiretrovirals, or ARVs. Your clinic can help you
                  cope
                  with your diagnosis, reduce risk behaviour and find other services such as nutrition information. Your
                  healthcare provider will be able to tell you when it becomes necessary to take medication.</p>

                <p><strong>What are antiretroviral drugs?</strong></p>

                <p>Antiretroviral drugs are used in the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. they fight HIV by
                  stopping
                  or interfering with the reproduction of the virus in the body.</p>

            <p>There are many mental-health conditions that can seriously affect a person’s behaviour, and disrupt their
              thinking, feeling and ability to relate to others.</p>

            <p>Mental illnesses are thought to be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. They can affect
              anybody – old or young, rich or poor.</p>

            <p>Most common forms of mental illness include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and
              panic attacks.</p>

            <p>Your mental health is as important as your physical health. Correct diagnosis of disorders, made by a
              professional, is very important. The earlier the diagnosis, the sooner treatment can begin.</p>

            <p>Risk factors for mental illness:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Genes: having a relative, such as a parent or sibling, with a mental illness.</li>
              <li>Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one’s death or a divorce.</li>
              <li>A traumatic experience, such as being assaulted or witnessing a violent event.</li>
              <li>Use of illegal drugs.</li>
              <li>Being abused or neglected as a child.</li>

            <div class="subsection-header">Depression</div>
            <div><p>Depression is a serious illness that affects many people. It goes beyond the
              feeling of ups and downs in your moods. It is a constant and deep feeling of emptiness and extreme despair or
              sadness. Depression affects how you feel about yourself, your sleep, the food you eat, and your relationships
              with your family and friends.</p>

              <p>According to a Who Report (2008), depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in both
                high-income and low- and middle-income countries. The same report also noted that while depression is the
                leading cause of disability for both men and women, the burden of depression is 50% higher for women than
                men.</p>

              <p>Depression is a disorder that can be reliably diagnosed and treated in primary care, but correct diagnosis
                is important.</p>

              <p>Signs and symptoms of depression:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities.</li>
                <li>Feelings of helplessness and guilt.</li>
                <li>Depressed mood.</li>
                <li>Change in appetite (eating more or eating less).</li>
                <li>Significant weight loss or gain.</li>
                <li>Constant mood swings.</li>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>
                <li>Suicidal thoughts or often having thoughts of death.</li>
                <li>Sleep disturbance (sleeping more or sleeping less).</li>
                <li>Lack of energy and feeling very tired.</li>

                    <p>Schizophrenia is one of the most common mental illnesses found throughout the world, in all races and
                      cultures, and affects both men and women equally. The age of onset for schizophrenia is usually late
                      adolescence to early and mid-twenties.</p>

                    <p>Symptoms of schizophrenia:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Delusions (false perceptions and beliefs): trouble with understanding reality and what is not
                        real.
                        for example, the person may believe that aliens or spies are controlling him/her.
                      </li>
                      <li>Paranoia: the unreal fear that someone is ‘out to get you’.</li>
                      <li>Hallucinations: seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or feeling things that do not really exist.
                      </li>
                      <li>Difficulties with language and expressing emotion: People with schizophrenia speak very little or
                        their speech is disjointed/disorganised. the person may even change the topic halfway through a
                        sentence.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p>Causes of schizophrenia:</p>

                    <p>Medical experts have not been able to agree on one single cause of the disorder. Instead, there are
                      numerous possibilities.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Genetics: When there’s family history of schizophrenia, there is a greater chance of another
                        family
                        member suffering from it.
                      </li>
                      <li>Chemical imbalance in the brain that affects behaviour.</li>
                      <li>Physical changes, such as a brain injury.</li>
                      <li>Some illegal drugs, such as cannabis (also known as dagga or marijuana) can cause schizophrenia
                        relapses or can lead to schizophrenia-like changes in the brain.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p><strong>Diagnosing schizophrenia</strong></p>

                    <p>If the doctor suspects possible schizophrenia, he/she will need to know about the patient’s medical
                      and
                      psychiatric history.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p>Certain tests will be ordered to rule out other illnesses and conditions that may trigger
                      schizophrenia-like symptoms. Examples of some of the tests may include:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Blood tests.</li>
                      <li>A brain image may be taken (to rule out tumours, problems in the structure of the brain, and other
                        conditions).
                      </li>
                      <li>Psychological evaluation: A specialist will assess the patient’s mental state by asking about
                        thoughts, moods, hallucinations, suicidal traits, violent tendencies or potential for violence, as
                        well as observing the patient’s demeanour and appearance.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                    <p><strong>Treating schizophrenia</strong></p>

                    <p>Schizophrenia is a serious condition that should not be left untreated. Although there is no cure,
                      schizophrenia can be managed with medication. Many people with schizophrenia are successfully treated
                      and go on to live productive, healthy lives.</p>

              <div class="subsection-header">Epilepsy and Seizures</div>
              <div><p>Epilepsy is a disorder where the nerve-cell activity in the brain is disturbed.
                During a seizure, different people behave differently – some just stare blankly for a few seconds, others’
                legs and arms twitch, while other people may convulse and/or lose consciousness.</p>

                <p>An epileptic seizure may be very quick, lasting only a few seconds to a few minutes. But a severe seizure
                  can result in a dangerous situation if the person is, for example, swimming or driving when it happens, or
                  if they fall hard or from a height.</p>

                <p>Proper diagnosis is very important. treatment may stop or reduce the frequency and intensity of seizures.
                  treatment usually includes medication and sometimes surgery.</p>

                <p>Risk factors for epilepsy:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Family history.</li>
                  <li>Head injuries.</li>
                  <li>Stroke and other blood-vessel diseases which can lead to brain damage.</li>
                  <li>Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, Aids and viral encephalitis.</li>
                  <li>Brain infections such as meningitis, which causes infl ammation in the brain or spinal cord.</li>
                  <li>Prenatal (before-birth) injury to the baby’s brain as a result of an infection in the mother, poor
                    diet
                    or not enough oxygen.
                  </li>
                  <li>High fevers in childhood, especially if these resulted in serious seizures.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Warning signs and symptoms of an epileptic episode:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Odd feelings (e.g. ‘out-of-body’ feelings, or when situations or people look unexpectedly familiar or
                    strange).
                  </li>
                  <li>Unusual smells or tastes.</li>
                  <li>Feeling ‘fuzzy’ or confused.</li>

                  <li>Unexpected loss of control of bowels or bladder.</li>
                </ul>

              <div class="subsection-header">Addiction</div>
              <div><p>Addiction is when a person depends too heavily on a certain substance, thing or
                behaviour. There are many different kinds of addiction. The most common are addictions to alcohol, drugs,
                gambling, the internet and pornography.</p>

                <p>The south African medical Research council says that 11% (5.7 million) of the south African population
                  will
                  suffer from some kind of addiction in their lifetime.</p>

                <p>Addiction may destroy your relationships with friends and family, damage your health, and lead to job
                  loss,
                  arrest and sometimes death.</p>

                <p>Signs and symptoms of addiction:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Inability to function without drugs, gambling, the internet, pornography or alcohol.</li>
                  <li>Having memory lapses or trouble concentrating.</li>
                  <li>Not feeling like doing anything; having little energy or self-discipline.</li>
                  <li>Poor physical coordination, and/or talking in a way that’s hard to understand (e.g. slurring).</li>
                  <li>Looking unhealthy (e.g. bloodshot eyes, sores on the face)</li>
                  <li>Not washing, brushing teeth or wearing clean clothes.</li>
                  <li>Regular spending of money on drugs, alcohol or gambling, even when the person doesn’t have enough
                    money.
                  </li>
                  <li>Lots of time spent searching for alcohol or drugs, or in a casino.</li>
                  <li>Owning drug-related equipment such as pipes, rolling papers or small decongestant bottles.</li>
                  <li>A smell of drugs, or of incense or other ‘cover-up’ scents.</li>
                  <li>Conversations and jokes that are centred around drugs, alcohol or gambling.</li>
                  <li>Being very dishonest – stealing, lying or cheating.</li>
